# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-10

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **REMOVED**: `identify()` method (GDPR/ePrivacy compliance)
- **REMOVED**: `reset()` method (no longer needed)
- **REMOVED**: AsyncStorage for user IDs

### Changed
- Session IDs now generated in RAM only (never persisted to AsyncStorage)
- New session ID generated on every app launch
- Sessions rotate automatically every 2 hours (was 30 minutes inactivity)
- Updated documentation URL from /docs/ to /sdk/

### Why This Change?
Storing identifiers on device (AsyncStorage) requires user consent under 
ePrivacy Directive Article 5(3). In-memory sessions require no consent, making 
Respectlytics designed for consent-free analytics.

### Migration
Remove any calls to `identify()` and `reset()`. Session management is now automatic.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-30

### Changed
- Standardized privacy documentation across all Respectlytics SDKs
- Clarified IP address handling: "Used only for geolocation lookup, then discarded"
- Updated README with consistent "Privacy by Design" section format
- Added "Automatic Behaviors" table for feature documentation

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- Initial release of Respectlytics React Native SDK
- `configure(apiKey)` - Initialize SDK with your API key
- `track(eventName, screen?)` - Track events with optional screen name
- `identify()` - Enable cross-session user tracking with auto-generated user ID
- `reset()` - Clear user ID for logout scenarios
- `flush()` - Force send queued events (rarely needed)
- Automatic session management with 30-minute timeout rotation
- Offline event queue with automatic retry when connectivity returns
- Background flush when app enters background state
- Event persistence to AsyncStorage (survives force-quit/crash)
- Automatic metadata collection: platform, os_version, app_version, locale, device_type
- 3-retry exponential backoff for network failures

### Privacy Features
- User IDs are randomly generated UUIDs, never linked to device identifiers
- No IDFA, GAID, Android ID, or any device identifiers collected
- User ID cleared on app uninstall
- No custom properties - only screen name allowed (by design)
